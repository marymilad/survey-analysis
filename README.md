# survey-analysis

There is an Excel workbook which contains an amalgamation of the survey responses and Temima’s coding. This will allow for more straight-forward regression analysis. I did not include all the columns of the survey results, just a few to get started. However, you can use the method I did to add the rest (mostly relies on VLOOKUP).
 
Any changes you make to that workbook you’ll need to save as dataset.csv, which the Python code uses.
 
Of course, if you just want to start over, you can. Temima has access to the Google sheet where she did the coding, and you can download from there.
